                        This answer really depends on your business and what you want to acheive.

                        I'm sure many people will disagree with me, but no, I do not believe that it is beneficial for every business to have a detailed marketing strategy, I do however believe all 
                        businesses would benefit from some sort of marketing plan, with goals in mind.

                        An example: as a local cafe you have an amazing amount of wonderful, regular customers who you see on a weekly basis. They have been with you for years and you are very grateful.
                        However, do you have a plan in place to encourage new customers in, should your regular customers stop coming in for any reason.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        It is so important to look after your regulars; but it is also important to find new ones too.

                        Without honesty I wouldn't have a business, therefore it is important that we are as upfront and honest with each other as possible.

                        If it takes me less time to complete the work than you have paid for, you can select to receive a reimbursement to the value of the time not worked (terms and conditions apply),
                        as you can select to have the time transferred to other project work, at a time to suit us both.
