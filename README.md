# Project Overview

A site promoting the marketing services offered from The Marketing Ally: a marketing consultant assisting small-medium organisations on small, short-term marketing projects, and providing guidance on budgets, plans, copywriting review and general marketing help.

Site visitors can purchase online marketing templates (plans, budgets etc.) using Stripe payments as a guest. Account owners receive a free review of the templates once completed, can buy work hours required for a project, and see their order history. Time slots for project work can be requested, but not booked. This will be a future feature where signed in account owners can book times.

# User Experience Design

## Strategy

For small-medium enterprises (SMEs), local to Gothenburg, looking for ad-hoc marketing support, but without the large contracts, costly retainers, or lengthy project pitches offered by larger marketing consultancies / agencies, or without the need to hire staff.

Users can purchase ad-hoc hours for project work, as well as purchase marketing templates online. Purchase of the marketing templates includes a free review of the documentation once completed (i.e. feedback on the budget, strategy, or plan as necessary) for account holders only. Users do not have to be logged in to purchase just the online templates, without the review.

### Target audience

Small business owners / sole traders who know what they are doing regarding their business, and know their customers and products, but require ad-hoc assistance with marketing. They do not need an employee or agency for the work, but rather the ability to purchase hours as needed, at a reasonable cost, to get the work done.

It is unnecessary and expensive for them to hire a full marketing agency, consultant, or employee, but rather what they are looking for is a more informal “chat” from someone who has marketing experience and can be a trusted source of feedback/sounding board, and/or create campaigns, but can be turned off at short notice, making budgeting easier. 

Allowing account owners to purchase and book hours through an online booking system fulfils this need.

Businesses in the main are local to Gothenburg to provide physical meetings, however digital hours can be purchased, allowing for custom furhter afield, as well as tapping into the remote work culture that exists due to covid. When purchasing digital hours, users are offered slightly longer to compensate for the lack of travel needed from the consultant.
